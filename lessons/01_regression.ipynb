    "We'll begin our foray into machine learning with **regression**. Regression is a **supervised** problem in which we use a set of features (also called independent variables or predictors) to try to predict a continuous output, or a real valued number. This is a supervised problem because we have an existing dataset in which we know what the actual outputs are for a set of samples. By showing a model enough examples, the hope is that the model can be trained to predict the output value given just the set of features, where the prediction is as close to the real value as possible.\n",

Many models can also be used for both sets of problems with small tweaks to their algorithms.\n",

Although it's somewhat simple in structure (compared to, for example, a neural network), linear regression is a very powerful model in its own right and can be effective when applied to many regression problems."

    "### What is Ordinary Least Squares?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, linear regression is nothing more than finding the best straight line, or line of best fit through a set of data points that most accurately captures the pattern that exists within those data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common picture people have of OLS is in the univariate case (2-D), which looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear-regression](../images/linear_regression_line.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we have *one* feature trying to predict an output. There are many points pertaining to the training samples, and we try and choose the right line that is as close to all the points as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we rarely predict with only a single feature! We're mostly in the multivariate case. In this scenario, where have many \"independent variable\" axes, but still one dependent variable axis. The \"line\" in this case turns into a **hyperplane** which tries to capture as much of the information about the multi-dimensional data points as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear-regression](../images/linear_regression_hyperplane.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we have two features trying to predict a third dependent variable. This is as far as we can go with visualizing OLS, because humans have a hard time visualizations higher dimensions. But the intuition is basically the same: we're trying to pick a hyperplane that minimizes the distances to the data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn an OLS model, we effectively are trying to choose the slope values (also called the weights). These are often depicted mathematically as the $\\beta$ values. There is additionally an intercept term (also called the bias term), which is really just a special case of a weight, generally denoted as $\\beta_0$. The univariate equation is probably familiar to a lot of you:\n",

    "y &= mx + b \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be more familiar with the $y=mx+b$ formulation, in which $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the intercept. This is how we specify a line. All we're doing in the second line is rewriting the notation: we're calling the intercept $\\beta_0$, and the slope $\\beta_1$. We also call the feature $X_1$. We're doing this because, when we have $P$ features (i.e., the multivariate case), this can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_P X_P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression, then, is to find a combination of these $\\beta_i$ values such that we pass through or as close to as many data points as possible. In other words, we are trying to find the values of $\\beta$ that reduce or minimize the aggregate distance between our linear model and the data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can formalize this into an optimization problem and pursue a strategy that is known in machine learning as minimizing the **cost function** or **objective function** or **loss**. In the case of linear regression, the cost function we are trying to minimize is the **mean squared error (MSE)** function:\n",

This algorithm is based off feature similarity, and uses data points that are similar to each other to predict the value of new data points. It does so by using a **distance metric** to quantify distance and therfore similarity between a set of points. In a KNN model, this distance metric can then be used to calculate an average value between $K$ data points that are most similar to the data point to be predicted in the feature space.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Euclidean distance} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}$$\n",

    "By calculating the average Eucliden distance of the `K` nearest points, we can derive a predicted value for a given data point."

    "\n",
    "Just like the linear regression models, `scikit-learn` provides a very easy interface to [train a KNN model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor). A quick look at the documentation gives away the fact that there are many more settings that can be altered compared to the previous models. KNN is a model that has much greater variability in performance based on these settings. These settings - chosen before we fit the model - are often called hyperparameters. So, choosing the right hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors - or **hyperparameter tuning** - is an important step in machine learning. Again, we won't cover specific methods today, but it is an important point to remember when using KNN models in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear regression models, a KNN model can be used for both regression and classification problems, so we should be sure to use the `KNNeighborsRegressor` class."
