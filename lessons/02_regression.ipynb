By showing a model enough examples, the hope is that the model can be trained to predict the output value given just the set of features, where the prediction is as close to the real value as possible."

    "### Categorical Variable Encoding (One-hot & Dummy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms require that categorical data be encoded numerically in some fashion. A common technique used is called One-hot-encoding, which creates `k` new variables for a single categorical variable with `k` categories (or levels), where each new variable is coded with a `1` for the observations that contain that category, and a `0` for each observation that doesn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using some machine learning alorithms, such as linear regression, ridge regression and elastic net regression (which we will use first), we can run into the so-called [\"Dummy Variable Trap\"](https://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html) when using One-Hot-Encoding on multiple categorical variables within the same set of features. This occurs because each set of one-hot-encoded variables can be added together across columns to create a single column of all `1`s, and so are multi-colinear when multiple one-hot-encoded variables exist within a given model. This can lead to misleading results when using the aforemetioned algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, we can simply add an intercept term to our model (which is all `1`s) and remove the first one-hot-encoded variable for each categorical variables, resulting in `k-1` so-called \"Dummy Variables\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily the `OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn` can perform both one-hot and dummy encoding simply by setting the `drop` parameter. Let's use it to transform the `cylinders`, `model year`, and `origin` variables into `k-1` dummy variables."

It may seem like a good thing when we are able to match our data as close as possible, but often times there are differences in the data samples in our test set compared to our training set. To avoid this, most models are paired with some form of regularization (or penalization) that tries to account for unseen data in the test set. This may impact the performance on our training data, but can lead to better predictions on test data and improve overall generalization."
