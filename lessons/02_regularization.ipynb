    "Many times, if we fit our models too closely to our training data, this can lead to a phenomenom called **overfitting**. It may seem like a good thing when we are able to match our data as close as possible, but often times there are differences in the data samples in our test set compared to our training set. To avoid this, most models are paired with some form of regularization (or penalization) that tries to account for unseen data in the test set. This may impact the performance on our training data, but can lead to better predictions on test data and improve overall generalization."

In other words, how much to care about the coefficient penalty term vs how much to care about the sum of squared errors term. The higher the value of alpha the more regularization, and the smaller the resulting coefficients will be.
