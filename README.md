# D-Lab's Python Machine Learning Fundamentals Workshop

This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Machine Learning Fundamentals workshop. Prior experience with [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals) is assumed.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide an introduction to machine learning in Python. First, we'll cover some machine learning basics, including its foundational principles, types of machine learning algorithms, how to fit models, and how to evaluate them. Then, we'll explore several machine learning tasks, includes classification, regression, and clustering. We'll demonstrate how to perform these tasks using `scitkit-learn`, the main package used for machine learning in Python. Finally, we'll go through an automatic model selection tool called `TPOT`.

Basic familiarity with Python is assumed. If you are not comfortable with the material in [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals), we recommend attending that workshop first.

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a powerful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.8 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals` folder you downloaded above.

3. Click `1_classification.ipynb` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

5. By default, the necessary packages for this workshop should already be installed. You can install them within the Jupyter notebook by running the following line in its own cell:

> ```!pip install seaborn pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter```

Note that all of the above steps can be run from the terminal, if you're familiar with how to interact with Anaconda in that fashion. However, using Anaconda Navigator is the easiest way to get started if this is your first time working with Anaconda.

## Is Python not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have Python or Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals%2F&branch=main).

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.
