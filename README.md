This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Machine Learning Fundamentals workshop. Prior experience with [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals) is assumed.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide an introduction to machine learning in Python. First, we'll cover some machine learning basics, including its foundational principles, types of machine learning algorithms, how to fit models, and how to evaluate them. Then, we'll explore several machine learning tasks, includes classification, regression, and clustering. We'll demonstrate how to perform these tasks using `scitkit-learn`, the main package used for machine learning in Python. Finally, we'll go through an automatic model selection tool called `TPOT`.

Basic familiarity with Python is assumed. If you are not comfortable with the material in [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals), we recommend attending that workshop first.

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals` folder you downloaded above.

3. Click `00_introduction.md` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.
